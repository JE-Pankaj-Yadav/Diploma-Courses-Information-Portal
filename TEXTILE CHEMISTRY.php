                        <h2>SOMTHING ABOUT TEXTILE CHEMISTRY</h2>
                        <h2>What is Textile Chemistry?</h2>
                        <p>Clothing is one of the basic requirements of life. This requirement cannot be substituted and hence contains a multitude within itself. Textile chemistry in the simplest of terms is a branch of applied chemistry that studies all about textiles and fabric, from their occurrence to their utilisation. Textile Chemistry uses the fundamentals of chemistry as the basis for studying and digging into the manufacturing of textiles as well as the technical compositions of the smallest unit of textiles. This scientific study, Textile Chemistry has a huge scope in itself as it is limited regarding one domain but still advanced within that very domain. Pursuing a career in textile chemistry would mean staying updated with the changes taking place over the years in yarns, fibres, weaves, compositions, dying, quality checking, storage, etc. Apart from mainstream Fashion Technology, this course has gained popularity in recent years because of its curriculum. A lot of renowned universities have been providing degrees in textile chemistry.</p>
                        <p>A lot of people at times incline to enter the fashion industry but do not have an interest in conventional ways, including designing. They, however, have a knack for production and keeping, this is the most suitable course in that regard. The textile Chemistry course is taught in top-level Universities, private and public both, with placement opportunities in renowned fashion brands.</p>

						<h2>Upcoming trends</h2>
						<p>The textile industry has probably been there for the longest time and yet the majority of the sector functions on the same old rule of thumb methods. This industry includes tedious manual work at the ground level and a hefty amount of time to accomplish simple tasks. Not just that, keeping tabs on the work done is a task in itself.</p>

						<p><b>Job Profiles Offered to Textile Chemistry Graduates</b></p>
                        <p>Degrees in textile chemistry are still underrated in India to other mainstream engineering courses. As an advantage of this factor, graduates and postgraduates in textile chemistry are limited in number, and the availability of the job market is almost always open.</p>
                        <p>The Monopoly of certain International brands producing and operating in India also influences the job profiles in Textile Chemistry field of candidates a great deal. Companies hire people to work under different departments which allows the candidates to acquire hands-on knowledge about the entirety of this industry. The same pattern is followed by lesser-known rival companies planning to jump up the market standing. This way, the candidate gets to work in different levels of profiles in the textile chemistry sector. However, these profiles still differ from company to company. Some of them include the quality control supervisor, garment technologist, textile chemist, and many more.</p>
                        <p>The following are some of the known Job Profiles for candidates pursuing a career in textile chemistry. There are a wide number of other profiles offered but given below are some widely accepted ones.</p>

						<h2>Required Skillset for Textile Chemistry</h2>
						<p><b>Skillsets Required for Textile Chemistry Course</b></p>
                        <p>The skills required for different job profiles vary vastly from one organisation to another. However, these skills can be broadly categorised into three umbrella terms given as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Technical skills:</b> Candidates who graduate in B.Tech textile chemistry are required to have technical skills as they assist in fulfilling intricate tasks and processing them smoothly.</li>
                            <li><b>Theoretical Base:</b> Scientific knowledge about chemistry and its fundamentals are very significant because of the need for practical application. Candidates must have a strong base of theoretical knowledge so that they can associate with the problems and interpret them according to the predetermined principles studied.</li>
                            <li><b>Analytical skills:</b> Textile chemistry involves drawing inferences, characterising properties into segments, and analysing the test conducted to dig results. Hence analytical skills are an integral part of textile chemistry.</li>
                        </ol>
						<h2>Course Curriculum for Textile Chemistry</h2>
						<p><b>Textile Chemistry- Course Curriculum</b></p>
                        <p>The division of Curriculum is an integration of a set of subjects distributed evenly into a specified number of semesters. The curriculum varies according to the type of degree pursued in textile chemistry.</p>
                        <p>The Master of Science in textile chemistry degree goes up to 4 semesters whereas the Bachelor of Technology in textile chemistry goes up to 8 semesters.</p>
                        <p>MSc in textile chemistry constitutes more theoretical knowledge based on principles, reactions, and laboratory applications whereas a B.Tech degree in textile chemistry entails more practical based knowledge, production, and composition. More or less, the subjects remain the same, but the qualifications differ slightly.</p>
