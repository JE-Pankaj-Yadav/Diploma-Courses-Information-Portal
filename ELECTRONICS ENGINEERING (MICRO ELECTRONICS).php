                        <h2>SOMTHING ABOUT ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING (MICRO ELECTRONICS)</h2>
                        <p>Microelectronics is a subfield of electronics. As the name suggests, microelectronics relates to the study and manufacture (or microfabrication) of very small electronic designs and components. Usually, but not always, this means micrometre-scale or smaller. These devices are typically made from semiconductor materials. Many components of normal electronic design are available in a microelectronic equivalent. These include transistors, capacitors, inductors, resistors, diodes and (naturally) insulators and conductors can all be found in microelectronic devices. Unique wiring techniques such as wire bonding are also often used in microelectronics because of the unusually small size of the components, leads and pads. This technique requires specialized equipment and is expensive.</p>
                        <h2>What is Microelectronics</h2>
						<p>Microelectronics is a field of engineering which deals with the study and manufacturing of small, tiny, even microscopic electronic designs and components.</p>
