                        <p>The suggestions mentioned below must be followed by students preparing for admission through entrance examination:</p>
                        <ul>
                        	<li>It is important to look after your wellbeing. Consume less oily foods and more antioxidant-rich foods. Stay hydrated on a daily basis.</li>
                        	<li>Make a schedule on how you want to divide your time between school and engineering exams. This will give you a better picture of what to research and when. It's also a good idea to figure out how many hours or days you'll devote to each subject, based on its difficulty level and your own strengths and weaknesses.</li>
                        	<li>It is recommended that you only read the books that are needed for the entrance exams.</li>
                        	<li>There are many formulas, equations, and terminologies in physics, chemistry, and mathematics. The easiest way to remember them is to learn them on a regular basis.</li>
                        	<li>Solve the sample papers provided by your coaching institutes or refer to previous year's entrance exam question papers.</li>
                        	<li>Rather than memorising terms, study to understand them. When you understand concepts clearly, you can easily answer any query, and the information stays with you forever.</li>
