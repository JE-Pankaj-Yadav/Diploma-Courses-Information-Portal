                        <h2>SOMTHING ABOUT ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING (ADVANCE MICROPROCESSOR AND INTERFACE)</h2>
                        <p>Electronic engineering is a sub-discipline of electrical engineering which emerged in the early 20th century and is distinguished by the additional use of active components such as semiconductor devices to amplify and control electric current flow. Previously electrical engineering only used passive devices such as mechanical switches, resistors, inductors and capacitors.</p>
                        <h2>Microprocessor</h2>
                        <p>A microprocessor is a computer processor where the data processing logic and control is included on a single integrated circuit, or a small number of integrated circuits. The microprocessor contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a computer's central processing unit. The integrated circuit is capable of interpreting and executing program instructions and performing arithmetic operations.[1] The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock-driven, register-based, digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results (also in binary form) as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic, and operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system.</p>
                        <H2>Electronics Engineering (Advance Microprocessor & interface)</H2>
                        <p>The study of Advance microprocessors in terms of architecture, software and interfacing techniques leads to the understanding of working of 8×86 family and Pentium processors. The development in microprocessors of 32 bit architecture brings the students face-to-face with mainframe enabling them to get employment in R&D, assembly, repair and maintenance of hardware of microprocessors and computers. Microprocessors find application in process control industry. They also form a part of the electronic switching system between source and destination in long distance telecommunications. Thus the microprocessor is an area of specialization. Students of electronics and related engineering branches often use microprocessors to introduce programmable control in their projects, in industrialized training.</p>
