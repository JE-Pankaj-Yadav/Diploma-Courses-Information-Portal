                        <ul>
                        	<li><b>Divide your schedule:</b> Studying without a deadline isnt something that candidates can afford, therefore they must assign their days to certain topics and finish them within the deadline.</li>
                        	<li><b>Keep your resources limited:</b> It is a must for candidates to remain focused and having too many resources will only alleviate the stress. Therefore, they must research well and shortlist some resources for the study plan and stick to it. Remember, Candidates can't cover everything from everywhere, therefore keep it simple and accurate.</li>
                        	<li><b>Revision is the Key</b>: Candidates should not keep revision for the last minute. They should keep revision sessions for regular intervals. They should make some crisp notes for the last minute reading and avoid unnecessary panic before the exam.</li>
                        </ul>
